# ET AI Hackathon 2026 — PS 6: AI for the Indian Investor

> **Hackathon:** ET AI Hackathon 2026 | Avataar.ai + Unstop
> **Problem Statement:** #6 — AI for the Indian Investor
> **Team size:** 4 members | **Duration:** 12 hours
> **Stack:** Python 3.11 + FastAPI · Next.js 14 · React · TailwindCSS

## Overview

This repo contains **4 independent AI products** built in parallel by 4 teammates.
Each product solves a different piece of PS 6. They share a common tech stack
and a shared `/shared/` utilities folder, but are otherwise fully independent —
one teammate going down does NOT block others.

---

## The 4 products

| # | Product | Teammate | Folder | Status |
|---|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Opportunity Radar** | T1 | `/opportunity-radar/` | 🔴 Todo |
| 2 | **Chart Pattern Intelligence** | T2 | `/chart-pattern-intel/` | 🔴 Todo |
| 3 | **Market ChatGPT — Next Gen** | T3 | `/market-chatgpt/` | 🔴 Todo |
| 4 | **AI Market Video Engine** | T4 | `/market-video-engine/` | 🔴 Todo |

## Shared setup (everyone does this first — H0 to H0:30)

### 1. Clone repo and install shared deps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dravv-alt/ET_GenAI_Hack.git
cd ET_GenAI_Hack
cp shared/.env.example shared/.env
# Fill in your API keys in shared/.env
```

### 2. Shared environment variables

```env
# shared/.env — fill these in before ANYONE starts coding

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxx        # LLM (preferred)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx                      # LLM (fallback)
LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514           # or: gpt-4o

TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-xxxxx                    # News search — free 1000/month
                                             # Sign up: app.tavily.com

# No other API keys needed — yfinance and NSE are free/public
```

### 3. Install Python shared deps

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn yfinance pandas ta-lib requests python-dotenv \
            anthropic openai langchain chromadb tavily-python pillow \
            moviepy matplotlib plotly
```

### 4. Install Node shared deps (per frontend)

```bash
cd <product>/frontend
npm install     # package.json is pre-configured per product
```

### 5. Verify everything works

```bash
python -c "import yfinance as yf; print(yf.Ticker('RELIANCE.NS').fast_info)"
# Should print Reliance's current price info
```

## How products connect for the demo

The 4 products are **independent** and demoed separately. For the final pitch:

- **T4 (Demo Lead)** runs a unified demo that shows all 4 products back to back
- Each product runs on its own port: Radar=3001, Charts=3002, ChatGPT=3003, Video=3004
- The 3-minute video shows each product completing its core workflow

---

## Sync checkpoints

| Time | What to share | Format |
|------|--------------|--------|
| H3 | Each person demos their MVP skeleton | 2 min screen share each |
| H6 | Core feature working | 2 min demo each |
| H9 | Full flow working, demo dry run | 5 min full walkthrough |
| H11 | Record pitch video, final push | All together |
